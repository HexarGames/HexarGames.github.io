<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Effective Date: November 23, 2023<br /></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">INTRO</span> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hexar Games LLP("<strong>Hexar Games</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our"</strong>) is a technology company that designs and develops mobile games. With this Privacy Policy, we aim to explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries where we do business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Where this Policy refers to "personal data" we mean any data or information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular natural person or household or any other data or information that constitutes "personal data," or "personally identifiable information".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This Privacy Policy applies to websites, mobile applications, forums, blogs, any offline services, our marketing and advertising activities on all platforms and other services that we may provide to you from time to time (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Hexar Games job applicants, employees, or other personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hexar Games is the controller of the personal data we hold about you in connection with your use of the Services. This means that we determine and are responsible for how your personal data is used. Under this Privacy Policy, your personal data shall be processed in order to provide the Services once you download our mobile applications, access and/or play our games, or interact with our Services. If you have any other concerns about providing data to us or it being used as described in this Privacy Policy, you may contact us and use your rights explained under Security section of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We may collect personal data directly from you or third-party companies who have obtained your consent or have another legal right to share such personal data with us (including advertising platforms, partners and data aggregators who have obtained it). This may include attributes about you and your interests, as well as other games and services you use, demographic and general location information. We will use your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Personal Data Collected Directly from You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hexar Games processes your personal data in order to provide the Services when you download, access and/or play our games or using our other Services. Most of this data comes directly from you. We collect the following information you provide in connection with our Services:</span></p>
<ul>

<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Survey Information</strong>, including feedback and ratings you provide relating to our Services.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Inferences</strong>, such as information generated from your use of the Services, reflecting predictions about your interests and preferences.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Parental Information, </strong>parent’s e-mail address and PIN to be created, only if you activate parental control setting in the Services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We use this data to provide our games and Services to you, including optimizing our Services, customization of in-game offers and verifying purchases. We may also use it for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Depending on which of our Services you interact with, we may collect and process the following types of information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Analytics Data</strong>, including details about how you use and interact with our games, advertising and other Services (for example, information about how and when you use our Services, what device you use to access our Services or details regarding profile visits, crash logs and diagnostic information about the performance of our Services on your device);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Device Data</strong>, including your unique device ID (persistent/non-persistent), Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA), Identifier for Vendor (IDFV), game center ID;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Location Data</strong>, including your location based on your Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>"); and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Commercial Information</strong>, such as products and services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual's computer and (ii) other related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, "<strong>cookies</strong>") to provide our website services. Please see the International Transfer section of this Privacy Policy for the detailed information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Personal Data Collected from Third Parties </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As mentioned above, most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our games or interact with our Services. However, when you allow third-party companies access to your personal data (e.g., downloading our mobile applications through App Store or Google Store and linking your Facebook account to mobile applications), we also collect information from such third parties.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Social Media</strong>: When you interact with our Services through various social media networks, such as when someone "Likes" us on Facebook or follows us, or shares our content on Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks, we may receive some information about individuals that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual's privacy settings with the social network and may include name, profile picture and friends list. Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites, social media networks, and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of the Services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you emails about products and services that may be of interest to you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Service Providers: </strong>When you install or purchase items related to our mobile apps (such as those you can purchase/download via App Store or Google Store), Hexar Games does not have access to your credit card or bank account data. However, third-party payment processors stated above may share non-financial information with us related to your purchases, like the items purchased to fulfill your order. The personal data received from third-party companies will depend on privacy settings on relevant third-party applications.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Information we receive from authentication services you connect to our Service</strong>: Some parts of our Services may allow you to log in through a third-party social network or authentication service such as Facebook. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us, which could include your name, email address and user ID associated with the third-party, profile picture, and the name and avatar of your Facebook friends that are already playing our games.The data we receive is dependent on that third party's policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. Where available, you will also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress) or access other functionality we make available in our games and other Services, such as inviting friends to play. You can choose not to allow us to access your email address in the Facebook dialog box when the first time you associate your Facebook account with your Hexar Games profile.<br />Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your permission, and we will not receive any information about your Facebook friends who do not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook friends to be able to see you and your progression in our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting from Facebook from our games and updating your app permissions from within your Facebook settings. If you choose not to create a Hexar Games profile by connecting your Facebook account, the personal data that we collect when you play our games will be linked to a random identifier rather than information that could identify you directly, but we will collect device-level identifiers and other information associated with those identifiers described above.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We recommend that you read Facebook's Privacy Policy (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy">https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy</a>) and review your privacy settings from time to time to ensure that you understand fully how your Facebook data is shared.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Other Sources:</strong>We may also collect personal data about individuals that we do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of our Services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>PURPOSES FOR PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices, you may use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our advertising partners may help us serve ads to you by combining your personal data with data they have collected about you elsewhere. They collect this information when you use their services or the websites and services of third parties. Our partners use this information to make assumptions about the kinds of advertising you would prefer to see. If they determine that you would be interested in seeing an advert for Hexar Games' Services, they will serve you with a Hexar Games advertising while using other websites and services. We use ad identifiers and similar technologies to provide our Services to you and in order to collect data from your device. These technologies allow our third-party advertising partners and us to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">recognize you and your device;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">provide interest-based advertising to you;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">allow our Services to interact with a third-party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">enable third parties and us to provide you with more customized services, for example, to provide our Services in the correct language.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, AdID, precise location data and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our third-party partners and we may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests and provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.</span></p>
